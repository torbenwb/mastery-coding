A collection of the projects I've worked on for Mastery Coding

## MC Game Development 1 Course Projects

A selection of the Unity game development projects I have worked on for Mastery Coding's Game Development pathway.

Each project was:
* Designed to be intuitive to first-time Unity users / students.
* Tested for usability and reliability with implementation in 800+ classrooms nationwide.

The *Alchemy Lab* project teaches students how to build a first-person interactive adventure / escape room. In this project students use the Unity C# Scripting API to build a first-person movement and camera system as well as an even-driven system for interactions and objectives.

* Implemented first-person camera and movement control using Unity C# Scripting API.
* Implemented event-driven architecture to handle player interactions and objectives.
